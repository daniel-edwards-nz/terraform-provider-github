# github_repository_topics

This resource allows you to create and manage topics for repositories within your GitHub organization or personal account.

~> Note: This resource is not compatible with the `topic` attribute of the `github_repository` Use either `github_repository_topics` or `topic` in `github_repository`. `github_repository_topics` is only meant to be used if the repository itself is not handled via terraform, for example if it's only read as a datasource (see [issue #1845](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github/issues/1845)).
