# github_repository_collaborators

Provides a GitHub repository collaborators resource.

~> Note: github_repository_collaborators cannot be used in conjunction with github_repository_collaborator and github_team_repository or they will fight over what your policy should be.

This resource allows you to manage all collaborators for repositories in your organization or personal account. For organization repositories, collaborators can have explicit (and differing levels of) read, write, or administrator access to specific repositories, without giving the user full organization membership. For personal repositories, collaborators can only be granted write (implicitly includes read) permission.

When applied, an invitation will be sent to the user to become a collaborators on a repository. When destroyed, either the invitation will be cancelled or the collaborators will be removed from the repository.

This resource is authoritative. For adding a collaborator to a repo in a non-authoritative manner, use github_repository_collaborator instead.
