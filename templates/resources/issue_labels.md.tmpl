# github_issue_labels

Provides GitHub issue labels resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage issue labels within your GitHub organization.

~> Note: github_issue_labels cannot be used in conjunction with github_issue_label or they will fight over what your policy should be.

This resource is authoritative. For adding a label to a repo in a non-authoritative manner, use github_issue_label instead.

If you change the case of a label's name, its' color, or description, this resource will edit the existing label to match the new values. However, if you change the name of a label, this resource will create a new label with the new name and delete the old label. Beware that this will remove the label from any issues it was previously attached to.
