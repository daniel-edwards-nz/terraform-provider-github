# github_team_repository

~> Note: github_team_repository cannot be used in conjunction with github_repository_collaborators or they will fight over what your policy should be.

This resource manages relationships between teams and repositories in your GitHub organization.

Creating this resource grants a particular team permissions on a particular repository.

The repository and the team must both belong to the same organization on GitHub. This resource does not actually *create* any repositories; to do that, see [`github_repository`](repository.html).

This resource is non-authoritative, for managing ALL collaborators of a repo, use github_repository_collaborators instead.

## Example Usage

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `team_id` - (Required) The GitHub team id or the GitHub team slug
* `repository` - (Required) The repository to add to the team.
* `permission` - (Optional) The permissions of team members regarding the repository. Must be one of `pull`, `triage`, `push`, `maintain`, `admin` or the name of an existing [custom repository role](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) within the organisation. Defaults to `pull`.
