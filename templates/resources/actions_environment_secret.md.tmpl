# github_actions_environment_secret

This resource allows you to create and manage GitHub Actions secrets within your GitHub repository environments. You must have write access to a repository to use this resource.

Secret values are encrypted using the [Go '/crypto/box' module](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which is interoperable with [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/). Libsodium is used by GitHub to decrypt secret values.

For the purposes of security, the contents of the `plaintext_value` field have been marked as `sensitive` to Terraform, but it is important to note that **this does not hide it from state files**. You should treat state as sensitive always. It is also advised that you do not store plaintext values in your code but rather populate the `encrypted_value` using fields from a resource, data source or variable as, while encrypted in state, these will be easily accessible in your code. See below for an example of this abstraction.
