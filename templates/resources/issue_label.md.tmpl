# github_issue_label

Provides a GitHub issue label resource.

This resource allows you to create and manage issue labels within your GitHub organization.

Issue labels are keyed off of their "name", so pre-existing issue labels result in a 422 HTTP error if they exist outside of Terraform. Normally this would not be an issue, except new repositories are created with a "default" set of labels, and those labels easily conflict with custom ones.

This resource will first check if the label exists, and then issue an update, otherwise it will create.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/issue_label/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `repository` - (Required) The GitHub repository

* `name` - (Required) The name of the label.

* `color` - (Required) A 6 character hex code, **without the leading #**, identifying the color of the label.

* `description` - (Optional) A short description of the label.

* `url` - (Computed) The URL to the issue label

## Import

GitHub Issue Labels can be imported using an ID made up of `repository:name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import github_issue_label.panic_label terraform:panic
```
