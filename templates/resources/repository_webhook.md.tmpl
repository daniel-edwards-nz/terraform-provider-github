# github_repository_webhook

This resource allows you to create and manage webhooks for repositories within your GitHub organization or personal account.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/repository_webhook/example_1.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `repository` - (Required) The repository of the webhook.

* `events` - (Required) A list of events which should trigger the webhook. See a list of [available events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/).

* `configuration` - (Required) Configuration block for the webhook. [Detailed below.](#configuration)

* `active` - (Optional) Indicate if the webhook should receive events. Defaults to `true`.

### configuration

* `url` - (Required) The URL of the webhook.

* `content_type` - (Required) The content type for the payload. Valid values are either `form` or `json`.

* `secret` - (Optional) The shared secret for the webhook. [See API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-a-hook).

* `insecure_ssl` - (Optional) Insecure SSL boolean toggle. Defaults to `false`.

## Attributes Reference

The following additional attributes are exported:

* `url` - URL of the webhook. This is a sensitive attribute because it may include basic auth credentials.

## Import

Repository webhooks can be imported using the `name` of the repository, combined with the `id` of the webhook, separated by a `/` character. The `id` of the webhook can be found in the URL of the webhook. For example: `"https://github.com/foo-org/foo-repo/settings/hooks/14711452"`.

Importing uses the name of the repository, as well as the ID of the webhook, e.g.

```
$ terraform import github_repository_webhook.terraform terraform/11235813
```

If secret is populated in the webhook's configuration, the value will be imported as "********".
